# Gene_annotation_tutorial

This tutorial is designed to guide you through the annotation of a specific gene of interest

## Background 

Genome sequencing is a powerful tool in modern genomics. But the DNA sequence alone is not particularly helpful! We want to know
-*Where* are the genes are in the genome 
-*What* are the genes doing 
-*Why* are these genes important

The first step is **Gene Annotation** in which we uncover where genes are located in the genome. For a review of genome annotation methods see https://www.nature.com/articles/35080529 "Genome annotation: from sequence to biology" by Lincoln Stein
